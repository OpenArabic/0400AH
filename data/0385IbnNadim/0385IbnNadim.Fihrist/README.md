## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

JK file had strange numbers at beginning of lines. 

## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

Pagination is the same. Same edition. Do I do have to adjust the line spacing of the digitized version.

Type your response here.
